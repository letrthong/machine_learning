Mathematics concept required for Deep Learning
Last Updated : 05 Sep, 2020
Why is Math required for Deep Learning?
Interested people who have the thirst to learn more about the concept behind a 
deep learning algorithm need to tackle Mathematics in some path of the way or another. 
Math is the core concept from which Deep Learning algorithms are built upon and is used 
to express the idea that seems quite obvious, but these are unexpectedly hard to elaborate 
and once it is elaborated properly, we can gain a proper understanding of the problem that 
we are given to solve. In this article, we are going to discuss in detail about the math
 required for Deep Learning. Now if there is a spark a light inside you, to learn more
 about deep learning then start with these Math topics:

Three reasons why mathematics will help in your future with a career in Deep Learning field:-
Math help in selecting a correct algorithm considering its complexity, training time, feature
 and accuracy
Approximate the right confidence interval and unpredictability.
Help in selecting an algorithm’s acceptance plan and in choosing its parameter setting.
Some of the interesting application requiring Deep Learning Algorithm: –
Suppose you have your great-great-grandfather black and while a picture may be captured 
in the early 20th century, well now with the help of Deep Neural Network its now possible 
to colourize that black and white picture and for a surprise, this is also possible with a video.
